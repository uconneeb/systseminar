### Sep. 3, 2020

We will discuss the [commentary by Mark Pagel](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01021-4) on the recent [Nature paper by Louca and Pennell](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2176-1) about how much information exists about speciation and extinction rates in extant time trees.

### Sep. 10, 2020

Today we will discuss this response to Louca and Pennell by Morlon, Hartig, and Robin: [Prior hypotheses or regularization allow inference of diversification histories from extant timetrees](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.185074).
