We are meeting this semester (Fall 2024) on Fridays from 1:20 to 2:20 in PBB 303 (i.e. BioPharm 3rd. floor fishbowl). Subscribe to [systematics listserv](/systseminar/listserv/) to receive emails containing connection information (or write to someone listed in [Contact Info](/systseminar/contact-info/)).

### August 30, 2024

This first meeting, those who are registered will sign up for a date to lead, and we'll have an informal discussion of what everyone's working on and what kind of seminar they want this to be this semester.

### September 6, 2024

This week we will start working on our minitheme of species delimitation by reading this chapter from a recently published book:

ML Smith and BC Carstens. 2022. Species delimitation using molecular data. Chapter 7 in: JS Wilkins, FE Zachos, and IY Pavlinov (eds.), _Species problems and beyond: contemporary issues in philosophy and practice_, 1st ed. CRC Press ISBN 9780367855604.

### September 13, 2024

We will discuss this paper, which is one of the few methods that does not require many loci.

N Puillandre, A Lambert, S Brouillet, and G Achaz. 2012. [ABGD, automatic barcode gap discovery for primary species delimitation.](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05239.x) Molecular Ecology 21:1864–1877. DOI:10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05239.x

Nick chose the paper below to discuss this week. He says "This paper will examine the difference in results between 5 different delimitation methods, including ABGD. It also is on the more digestible side as it only involves one mitochondrial locus, which should offer us more chances for discussion about barcoding."

C Blair and RW Bryson Jr. 2017. [Cryptic diversity and discordance in single-locus species delimitation methods within horned lizards (Phrynosomatidae: Phrynosoma).](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12658) Molecular Ecology Resources 17:1168–1182. DOI:10.1111/1755-0998.12658
