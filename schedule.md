We are meeting this semester on Mondays at 8:00-9:00am online. We are (at least at the beginning) reviewing some of the talks presented at the Evolution meetings this past summer, the videos of which will be available all semester (and it only costs $10 to gain access at this late date).

EEB alum Jack Phillips joined us from Utah (at the brutal hour of 6am!) to answer questions about his talk entitled "Lung evolution in anuran tadpoles". The main question is whether moving from ponds to streams predisposes tadpoles to "lose" their lungs, which really means delay their lung development until metamorphosis, due to the increased risk of being swept away by the current due to the increased buoyancy provided by inflated lungs.

Some background on the methods Jack used can be found in the [BayesTraits manual](http://www.evolution.rdg.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV3.0.5/BayesTraitsV3.0.5.html), specifically pages 26-32 corresponding to sections "Discrete" through "Discrete:Covarion".

Let's take a look this week at the talk "A new method for inferring large-scale time-calibrated species trees" presented by Deren Eaton. To see the talk, you will need to register for the meetings at https://evolutionmeetings.org (scroll down to the section entitled "Evolution 2021 post-conference registration is  still open!" and click the "here" link in that paragraph). 

This talk mentions the following review paper, which would be excellent background reading for this week:

GP Tiley, JW Poelstra, M dos Reis, Z Yang, and A Yoder. 2020. Molecular clocks without rocks: new solutions for old problems. Trends in Genetics 36(11):845-856. [DOI:10.1016/j.tig.2020.06.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2020.06.002)
