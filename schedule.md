We are meeting this semester on Wednesdays 1:30-2:30pm online. We are planning to work through selected chapters of the book "Tree thinking: an introduction to phylogenetic biology" (D. A. Baum and S. D. Smith. 2013. Roberts and Company, Publishers, Greenwood Village, Colorado), supplemented by additional papers on specific topics.

### Feb. 17, 2021

Elizabeth Jockusch will lead the discussion on the following paper:

Patton et al. 2020. [Hybridizing salamanders experience accelerated diversification](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63378-w) Scientific Reports 10:6566.

Recommended background reading: Baum and Smith Ch. 10 pp. 316-322 with view to the question of what it means to apply this model of character evolution to hybridization as a trait and also Ch. 11, pp. 378-381 for a basic model of trait-associated diversification.

### Feb. 10, 2021

Zach Muscavitch will lead the discussion on the following paper:

Varga et al. 2019. [Megaphylogeny resolves global patterns of mushroom evolution.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-019-0834-1) Nature Ecology and Evolution 3:668-678.

Ch. 11, pp. 371-381 in Baum and Smith, gives a good overview of several of the methods, so bring questions about that as well.

### Feb. 3, 2021

Tanner Matsen will lead the discussion on the following paper:

Allio et al. 2021. [Genome-wide macroevolutionary signatures of key innovations in butterflies colonizing new host plants.](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20507-3) Nature Communications 12:354. 

Chapters 10 and 11 of the Baum and Smith book are also recommended background reading, especially the first part of chapter 10 (pp. 305-324), which discusses trait mapping methods.

## Past discussions

### Jan. 27, 2021

Elizabeth Jockush lead discussion on Chapter 4 in Baum and Smith as well as the [2019 paper by Al Sayad and Yassin](https://doi.org/10.1002/evl3.115).
