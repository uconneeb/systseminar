**Postponed:** Zach will dicuss the paper Jorna et al. 2021. [Species boundaries in the messy middleâ€”A genome-scale validation of species delimitation in a recently diverged lineage of coastal fog desert lichen fungi](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8467) Ecology and Evolution 11(24):18615-18632.

Instead of the paper above, we plan to discuss species delimitation in general. Here is a possible background paper to read (sorry for the late notice):

de Queiroz, K. 2007. Species concepts and species delimitation. Systematic Biology 56(6):879-886.
