We are meeting this semester (Spring 2026) on Fridays from 11:15-12:05 in TLS 171b (i.e. the Bamford Conference Room).

If you are a UConn graduate student interested in Systematics and would like to join us, please
write to [Paul Lewis](mailto:paul.lewis@uconn.edu) for a permission number.

### January 23, 2026

Let's begin with an easy read that will give us some perspective on the field of Systematics and also will allow time to discuss possible topics or themes for the semester:

FJ Rohlf. 2025. Too many numbers? Systematic Biology [DOI:10.1093/sysbio/syaf076](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syaf076)

### January 30, 2026

Analisa chose this paper for discussion this week:

J Villamil, M Morando, LJ vila, FM Lanna, EM Fonseca, JW Sites Jr, and A Camargo. 2025. Revisiting the multispecies coalescent model fit with an example from a complete molecular phylogeny of the _Liolaemus wiegmannii_ species group (Squamata: Liolaemidae). Systematic Biology 75:72-87.
