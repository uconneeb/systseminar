### February 20, 2023

This week we're working through the last part of Chapter 11 in Revell and Harmon (sections 11.3 HiSSE and 11.4 QuaSSE).

### February 13, 2023

This week let's work through the first 2 major sections of Chapter 11 in the Revell and Harmon book: 11.2 BiSSE and 11.3 MuSSE. We'll save the (really long) HiSSE and QuaSSE models for a later week to avoid R coding burnout. If you finish those first 2 sections and still have some time to kill, you might want to read through the excellent paper in which the BiSSE model was introduced:

WP Maddison, PE Midford, SP Otto, and T Oakley. 2007. Estimating a binary character's effect on speciation and extinction. Systematic Biology 56:701-710. [DOI:10.1080/10635150701607033](https://doi.org/10.1080/10635150701607033)

### February 6, 2023

This week we'll discuss this paper comparing estimation of speciation and extinction rates derived from fossils vs. molecular time trees.
 
NS Upham, JA Esselstyn, and W Jetz. 2021. [Molecules and fossils tell distinct yet complementary stories of mammal diversification.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.07.012) Current Biology 31:4195-4206.e3.

### January 30, 2023

This week we will discuss the [Nature paper by Louca and Pennell](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2176-1) about how much information exists about estimating variable speciation and extinction rates in time trees.

You might want to first read the short [commentary by Mark Pagel](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01021-4)

### January 23, 2023

This week we will work through Chapter 10 in the Revell and Harmon book. We can choose to change direction for subsequent meetings, so be thinking about what you want Systematics Seminar to be about this semester.
