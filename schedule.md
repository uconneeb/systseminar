We are meeting this semester (Fall 2025) on Fridays from 11:15-12:05 in TLS 171b (i.e. the Bamford Conference Room).

If you are a UConn graduate student interested in Systematics and would like to join us, please
write to [Paul Lewis](mailto:paul.lewis@uconn.edu) for a permission number. 

Subscribe to [systematics listserv](/systseminar/listserv/) to receive emails containing connection information (or write to someone listed in [Contact Info](/systseminar/contact-info/)).

Organizational meeting

### September 5, 2025

Nick chose this paper to discuss:

BP Waldron, EF Watts, DJ Morgan, MM Hantak, AR Lemmon, EC Moriarty Lemmon, and SR Kuchta. 2025. 
The limits of the metapopulation: lineage fragmentation in a widespread terrestrial salamander (_Plethodon cinereus_).
Systematic Biology 74(1):1–15
DOI:[10.1093/sysbio/syae053](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syae053)

### September 12, 2025

Analisa chose this paper to discuss:

MS Gill, G Baele, MA Suchard, P Lemey. 2025. Infinite mixture models for improved modeling of across-site evolutionary variation. Molecular Biology and Evolution 42:1-21. DOI:[10.1093/molbev/msaf199](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaf199)

We know this paper will be a heavy lift for some (most?) of you, so Analisa will explain the basic ideas behind the methods compared at the start of the seminar.

### September 19, 2025

Kim chose this paper to discuss:

JY Lim, CR Marshall, EA Zimmer, WL Wagner. 2019. Multiple colonizations of the Pacific by _Peperomia_ (Piperaceae): complex patterns of long‐distance dispersal and parallel radiations on the Hawaiian Islands. Journal of Biogeography 46:2651–2662. [DOI:10.1111/jbi.13717](https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.13717)

### September 26, 2025

Doug will lead discussion on this paper:

L Yuanning, X-X Shen, B Evans, CW Dunn, and A Rokas. 2021.
Rooting the animal tree of life.  MBE 38:4322–4333.
[DOI:10.1093/molbev/msab170](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msab170)

### October 3, 2025

Netanya will lead discussion on this paper, which provides a nice follow-up to our discussion last week:

DT Schultz, SHD Haddock, JV Bredeson, RE Green, O Simakov, and DS Rokhsar. 2023. Ancient gene linkages support ctenophores as sister to other animals. Nature 618:110-117. [DOI:10.1038/s41586-023-05936-6](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05936-6)

### October 10, 2025

Crystal will lead discussion on this paper, which examines the relationship between sympatric speciation and morphological divergence in plants.

I Olivares, S Fourby, R Cámara-Leret, and AL Pigot. 2025. The likelihood of sympatric speciation and morphological divergence in plants. PNAS 122(34):e2508958122 [DOI:10.1073/pnas.2508958122](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2508958122)

### October 17, 2025

Nick Van Gilder will present some of his own work this Friday, which involves using ddRAD data to characterize diversity in the plethodontid salamander species _Batrachoseps diabolicus_.

Nick suggests the following paper as background reading. He says "My 2nd dissertation chapter uses genomic approaches to characterize range-wide diversity (and eventually, the presence of cryptic species) within _B. diabolicus_, so being familiar with at least that species would be a good leg up for Friday's discussion. I don't think people need to commit to the entire thing if they're time limited, though sections following the BIOCHEMICAL DATA HEADER after the description sections are worth reading."

EL Jockusch, DB Wake, and KP Yanev. 1998. New species of slender salamanders, _Batrachoseps_ (Amphibia: Plethodontidae), from the Sierra Nevada of California. Contributions in Science (Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County): 472:1-17.

### October 24, 2025

Analisa and Paul will present some results from Analisa's dissertation research having to do with measuring the information content of data for species tree inference. 

For some background, please read the indicated sections of this paper:

DG Brown and M Owen. 2020. The mean and variance of phylogenetic trees. Systematic Biology 69(1):139-154. [DOI:10.1093/sysbio/syz041](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syz041)

While you are welcome to read the entire paper, we will *not actually be discussing this paper* _per se_ and so these sections are the most important for background into what we will be discussing:
* Introduction
* Mean and Variance
* Other Measures of Centrality and Variance

### October 31, 2025

Meghan has chosen the following paper for discussion:

T Zhao, A Zwaenepoel, JY Xue, SM Kau, Z Li, ME Schranz, and Y Van der Peer. 2021. Whole-genome microsynteny-based phylogeny of angiosperms. Nature Communications 12:3498 [DOI:10.1038/s41467-021-23665-0](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23665-0)
