**Postponed:** Zach will dicuss the paper Jorna et al. 2021. [Species boundaries in the messy middle—A genome-scale validation of species delimitation in a recently diverged lineage of coastal fog desert lichen fungi](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8467) Ecology and Evolution 11(24):18615-18632.

Instead of the paper above, we plan to discuss species delimitation in general. Here is a possible background paper to read (sorry for the late notice):

de Queiroz, K. 2007. Species concepts and species delimitation. Systematic Biology 56(6):879-886.

Nick Van Gilder has chosen the following paper on species delimitation in geckos for this week. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of one of the most prominent Bayesian species delimitation methods, BPP, to the guide tree and prior for theta, the parameter that determines mean time to coalescence within populations (larger values mean deeper average coalescence times, all other things equal).
