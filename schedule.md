We are meeting this semester on Mondays at 8:00-9:00am online. Subscribe to [systematics listserv](/systseminar/listserv/) to receive emails containing connection information (or write to someone listed in [Contact Info](/systseminar/contact-info/)).

We are (at least at the beginning) reviewing some of the talks presented at the Evolution meetings this past summer, the videos of which will be available all semester (and it only costs $10 to gain access at this late date).

### Oct. 11, 2021

Paul thought this talk describing an interesting and different approach to evaluating the appropriateness of different models for continuous morphological traits would be an interesting topic for discussion: [Teisha King: Identifying atypical modes of continuous trait evolution](https://evolution.econference.io/public/fN8kqCq/main/sessions/18550)

This applet provides an easy way to learn about the difference between the BM and OU models that feature in this talk: [Ornstein-Uhlenbeck vs. Brownian motion model](https://plewis.github.io/applets/ou/)

You also need to know a little bit about phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC) to understand this talk. Here is the original classic paper that introduced PIC (and also founded the field of phylogenetic comparative methods): [J Felsenstein. 1985. Phylogenies and the comparative method. The American Naturalist 125:1-15.](https://doi.org/10.1086/284325). You don't need to understand all parts of this paper in order to understand the talk. All you really need to know is what a phylogenetic independent contrast is: a measure of how different a trait is between two sister taxa. The math in this paper is all about handling the fact that there is some extra uncertainty associated with ancestral reconstructions of trait values deeper in the tree because you have not actually observed those ancestral trait values, and the amount of uncertainty grows with how far the ancestral node is from the tips of the tree (where you _can_ observe trait values).

Zach will be talking about cotemporal diversification across independent lineages to infer shared evolutionary events. You can find the link the talk here: [Jamie Oaks: Expanding the space of phylogenetic trees to infer patterns predicted by shared processes of diversification](https://evolution.econference.io/public/fN8kqCq/main/sessions/18480/99926)

Additional reading for this talk can be found in the preprint linked here: [doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453597](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453597)

From Mark Stukel: For Monday's reading/viewing, I have chosen a talk about using the Fossilized Birth-Death process to improve uncertainty in fossil ages. It nicely follows up on our discussion last time about uncertainty in fossil ages as well as fossil placement. Here is the talk: 
[https://evolution.econference.io/public/fN8kqCq/main/sessions/18480/98885](https://evolution.econference.io/public/fN8kqCq/main/sessions/18480/98885)

For background reading, I think it would be useful to read the original paper outlining the Fossilized Birth-Death method, which is linked here: [https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1319091111](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1319091111)

Let's take a look this week at the talk "A new method for inferring large-scale time-calibrated species trees" presented by Deren Eaton. To see the talk, you will need to register for the meetings at https://evolutionmeetings.org (scroll down to the section entitled "Evolution 2021 post-conference registration is  still open!" and click the "here" link in that paragraph). 

This talk mentions the following review paper, which would be excellent background reading for this week:

GP Tiley, JW Poelstra, M dos Reis, Z Yang, and A Yoder. 2020. Molecular clocks without rocks: new solutions for old problems. Trends in Genetics 36(11):845-856. [DOI:10.1016/j.tig.2020.06.002](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tig.2020.06.002)

### Sep. 13, 2021

EEB alum Jack Phillips joined us from Utah (at the brutal hour of 6am!) to answer questions about his talk entitled "Lung evolution in anuran tadpoles". The main question is whether moving from ponds to streams predisposes tadpoles to "lose" their lungs, which really means delay their lung development until metamorphosis, due to the increased risk of being swept away by the current due to the increased buoyancy provided by inflated lungs.

Some background on the methods Jack used can be found in the [BayesTraits manual](http://www.evolution.rdg.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV3.0.5/BayesTraitsV3.0.5.html), specifically pages 26-32 corresponding to sections "Discrete" through "Discrete:Covarion".
