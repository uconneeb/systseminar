We have not yet decided when to meet this semester (Fall 2025).

There will be an **organizational meeting** Friday, August 29, 11:15am, in the Bamford Room (TLS 171b) in which we will decide on a time/day-of-the-week to meet.

If you are a UConn graduate student interested in Systematics and would like to join us, please
write to [Paul Lewis](mailto:paul.lewis@uconn.edu) for a permission number.
